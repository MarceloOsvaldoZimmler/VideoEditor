*******************************************************************
Please Note: Rebuilding from source is NOT required for typical
deployments of Movie Masher. Most changes can be made by adjusting
the XML configuration supplied with the examples. Exceptions 
include fonts and skin graphics - see the online documentation
for instructions on rebuilding those. Rebuilding other FLA files
would usually only be needed if you're creating your own modules.
*******************************************************************

This source directory contains the following files:

	/as3 - all ActionScript files used by FLA files
	/docs - documentation autogenerated from AS files
	/fla - all FLA files, include fonts and skins
	/font - open source fonts used in FLAs
	/pbj - Pixel Bender binary files
	/pbk - Pixel Bender source files
	/README.txt - this file
	/swfobject - source for swfObject and expressInstall

In order to build SWF files from the FLAs here, this whole source
directory must be on the same directory tier as the moviemasher
directory. This will allow the relative paths specified in the FLA
publish options to work correctly. 

Reading the online documentation at moviemasher.com is highly
recommended before reading through the auto generated documentation in
this directory, which is far from complete. Please feel free to ask
questions on the forum if you're interested in how the code works under
the hood.
