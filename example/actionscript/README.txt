
ActionScript Example Read Me
----------------------------

This example deployment is essentially the same as the 'static' example, except the Movie Masher
applet is pulled in by another SWF instead of directly from the index file. Note the addition of the
container.swf file and associated source FLA file containing the AS3 code.

Extend this example by editing the ActionScript code in the container.fla file, or replacing it with
your own Adobe FlashË‡ project. See the 'javascript' example for some of the possibilities offered by
Movie Masher's evaluate API, which is also available through ActionScript.

actionscript:
	index.html: uses swfobject to pull in container.swf
	media:
		swf:
			container.fla: source file contains ActionScript
			container.swf: pulls in MovieMasher and controls it
		xml:
			config.xml: loads the rest of the XML files
			control_nav_module.xml: contains control tags for modular media tabs
			control_nav.xml: contains control tags for media tabs and embeds control_nav_module.php
